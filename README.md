## creating Your GEMINI_API_KEY
Before running this project, you need an API key from Google Gemini. Follow these steps:
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on **Get API Key** (youâ€™ll see this in the top right menu under "Get API key").
4. Copy the generated API key (it will look like a long random string).
   (example it look like="Awcccc-xxxxxxxxxx")

## Setting Up the API Key

We store the API key in a `.env` file so it is **not hardcoded** in the code for safety purpose
1. create your project folder and crate a new file with ".env" name
2. Open `.env` and paste this line:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with the key you copied from Google AI Studio.
3. Save the file.
